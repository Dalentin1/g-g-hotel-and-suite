      <h2><b><ins>Musical Instruments Classification</ins></b></h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the study of musical instruments, organology, 
      there are many different methods of classifying musical instruments. 
      Most methods are specific to a particular cultural group and were developed to serve the requirements 
      of that culture and its musical needs. Such classification schemes often break down when applied outside 
      of their original context. For example, a classification based on instrument use may fail when applied to
      culture which has a different use, or even multiple uses, for the same instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout history, various methods of musical instrument classification have been used by musicians & 
      scholars. The most commonly used system divides instruments into string instruments (often divided into 
      plucked and bowed), wind instruments (often divided into woodwind and brass), and percussion instruments 
      with modern classifications adding electronic instruments as a distinct class of instrument; however, 
      other schemes have also been devised.
    </p>
    <p><b>The original Sachs-Hornbostel system classified instruments into four main groups:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Idiophones:</b> such as the xylophone, which produce sound by vibrating themselves</li>
      <li><b>Membranophones:</b> such as drums or kazoos, which produce sound by a vibrating membrane</li>
      <li><b>Chordophones:</b> such as the piano or cello, which produce sound by vibrating strings</li>
      <li><b>Aerophones:</b> such as the pipe organ or oboe, which produce sound by vibrating columns of air.</li>
      </ol>

     <h3>Western Instruments</h3>
      <p>
        That was just a brief explanation of musical instruments and how they are categorized. But today we want
        to talk about Western instruments. But today we are going to be talking about the instruments used in playing
      classical music. There are main grouped into 4 parts.
      </p>
    <li>Strings</li>
    <li>Woodwind</li>
    <li>Brass</li>
    <li>Precussion</li>
    <p>
      We would be talinkg about 2 instruments from the Strings family, the Brass
      family then one from the woodwind family.

     <p>The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone (string
      instrument) in the violin family. Most violins have a hollow wooden body. It is the smallest 
      and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in the family in regular use. The violin typically
      has four strings, (some can have five), usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5.

     <p> The clarinet is a type of single-reed woodwind instrument. Like many wind
      instruments, clarinets are made in several different sizes, each having
      its own range of pitches. All have a nearly-cylindrical bore and a flared bell, and utilize a 
      mouthpiece with a single reed. A person who plays a clarinet is called a clarinetist 
      (sometimes spelled clarinettist). While the similarity in sound between the earliest clarinets and the 
      trumpet may hold a clue to its name.<a href="Clarinetpage.html">Read more.</a></p>

     <p>The trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz
      ensembles. The trumpet group ranges from the piccolo trumpet with the
      highest register in the brass family, to the bass trumpet, which is
      pitched one octave below the standard Bâ™­ or C Trumpet. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been 
      used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC. They began
      to be used as musical instruments only in the late 14th or early 15th century.

    <p>
      <img src="Tuba3.jpg" alt="image of tuba" height="400" width="400" class="responsive"/>
     <p>The tuba is the lowest-pitched musical instrument in the brass family. As
      with all brass instruments, the sound is produced by lip vibration-a buzz-into a mouthpiece. It first 
      appeared in the mid-19th century, making it one of the newer instruments in the modern orchestra and 
      concert band. The tuba largely replaced the ophicleide. Tuba is Latin for "trumpet". A person who plays 
      the tuba is called a tubaist, a tubist.<a href="Tubablogpage.html">Read more.</a></p>

     <p>The harp is a stringed musical instrument that has a number of individual
      strings running at an angle to its soundboard; the strings are plucked
      with the fingers. Harps can be made and played in various ways, standing or sitting and in orchestras or 
      concerts. Its most common form is triangular in shape and made of wood. Some have multiple rows of 
      strings and pedal attachments. Ancient depictions of harps were recorded in current day Iraq.
