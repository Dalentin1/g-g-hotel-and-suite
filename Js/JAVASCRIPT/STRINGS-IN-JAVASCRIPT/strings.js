// Type of Escape Seqencen in Javascript
// imagine you're trying to print a result that is a string datatype and you mean need to add qoute marks in your text. To do this you need a backslash escape character
document.write("Hi there. \"Welcome\" to Codeland") // that's and example of backslash escape character
document.write("<br>");
document.write("It\'s Alright");
document.write("The character \\ is called backslash"); // if you note only one of the slashs dispalys on the screen the other one is read as an escape character by the computer.
