// JavaScript statement's are the instructions that tells the browser to perform certain actions.
// Control statments are also instructions they govern the flow of control in a program.

// There are two types of control statements (Conditional Statements, Iterative/Loopin control statements

// CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
// its used when we have to make decisions based on conditions, or when we're faced with two choices.
// there're two types of conditional statememts (if-eles, switch)

// ITERATIVE STATEMENTS
// Its used when the want to perform an instruction more than once, instead of writing each time its needed we use loops to perform the actions any number of time.
// there're four types of iterative statements (For, While, Do While, For in)

// CONTINUE/BREAK
// We won't call them types of statements they assist other types of statements.

// BREAK
// this is used to exist a switch statement or loop. like when using a loop it breaks it then start excuting the code after it.

//CONTINUE
// this breaks a single iteartion when used in a loop.
