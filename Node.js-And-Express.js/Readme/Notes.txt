Node js is an environment to run javascript outside the browser

it was built on Chrome's V8 JS Engine and was created in 2009

There're differencies between browser javascript and node javascript 

The Browser Javascript has the following features

DOM : has the document object model.

Window : Has the window object.

Interactive Apps : we build interactive apps with the browser.

No Filesystem : we can't access the file system when working with browser js.

Fragmentataion : when working with the browser js we need to check and see if our applications working with every user browser else we get bugs.

ES6 Modules : in browser modules are optional

While the Node Js has the following features

No DOM : has no document object model.

NO Window : the node js is run outside the browser environment so we can't access any of the browser features.

Server Side Apps : we only work build server side applications with node js. So our code would be fully logic no graphical interface.

Filesystem : we're able to access the filesystem when we work with node js, filesystem like info about our operating system, respones to network request.

Versions : when we build with node js we don't always have to upgrade to a new node version even if we built withn an older version.

CommonJs : in node js we have access to modules by default and we work with them constantly, and node js uses common js library for the modules.
