    <b><h3>Classical Music</h3></b>
    <p>
      <b>Classical music</b> generally refers to the formal musical tradition of
      the Western world, considered to be distinct from Western folk music or
      popular music traditions. It is sometimes distinguished as Western
      classical music, as the term "classical music" may also refer to
      non-Western traditions which exhibit similar formal qualities. In addition
      to formality, classical music is often characterized by complexity in its
      musical form and harmonic organization,[1] particularly with the use of
      polyphony.[2] Since at least the 9th-century it has been primarily a
      written tradition,[2] spawning a sophisticated notational system, as well
      as accompanying literature in analytical, critical, historiographical,
      musicological and philosophical practices. A foundational component of
      Western Culture, classical music is frequently seen from the perspective
      of individual or groups of composers, whose compositions, personalities
      and beliefs have fundamentally shaped its history.
