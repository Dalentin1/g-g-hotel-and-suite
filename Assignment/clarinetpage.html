      The clarinet is a type of single-reed woodwind instrument. Like many wind
      instruments, clarinets are made in several different sizes, each having
      its own range of pitches. All have a nearly-cylindrical bore and a flared
      bell, and utilize a mouthpiece with a single reed. A person who plays a
      clarinet is called a clarinetist (sometimes spelled clarinettist). While
      the similarity in sound between the earliest clarinets and the trumpet may
      hold a clue to its name, other factors may have been involved. During the
      Late Baroque era, composers such as Bach and Handel were making new
      demands on the skills of their trumpeters, who were often required to play
      difficult melodic passages in the high, or as it came to be called,
      "clarion" register. Since the trumpets of this time had no valves or
      pistons, melodic passages would often require the use of the highest part
      of the trumpet's range, where the harmonics were close enough together to
      produce scales of adjacent notes. The trumpet parts that required this
      specialty were known by the term clarino and this in turn came to apply to
      the musicians themselves. The word clarinet may have come from the
      diminutive version of the clarion or clarino and it has been suggested
      that clarino players may have helped themselves out by playing
      particularly difficult passages on these newly developed "mock
      trumpets".[1] Johann Christoph Denner is generally believed to have
      invented the clarinet in Germany around the year 1700 by adding a register
      key to the earlier chalumeau, usually in the key of C. Over time,
      additional keywork and airtight pads were added to improve the tone and
      playability.[2] The most common clarinet is the B♭ clarinet. The clarinet
      in A, pitched a semitone lower, is also regularly used in orchestral,
      chamber, and solo music. The bass clarinet has been common in orchestras
      since the middle of the 19th century. The modern bass clarinet is in B♭
      but has extra keys to extend the register down to low written C3. The
      clarinet family ranges from the (extremely rare) BBB♭ octo-contrabass to
      the A♭ piccolo clarinet. The clarinet is used in classical music, concert
      bands, military bands, marching bands, klezmer, jazz, and other styles.

    <p><h1><b>History</b></h1></p>
    <p>
        The word clarinet may have entered the English language via the French clarinette (the feminine diminutive of Old French clarin or clarion), or from Provençal clarin, "oboe".
It would seem, however, that its real roots are to be found among some of the various names for trumpets used around the Renaissance and Baroque eras. Clarion, clarin, and the Italian clarino are all derived from the medieval term claro, which referred to an early form of trumpet. This is probably the origin of the Italian clarinetto, itself a diminutive of clarino, and consequently of the European equivalents such as clarinette in French or the German Klarinette. According to Johann Gottfried Walther, writing in 1732, the reason for the name is that "it sounded from far off not unlike a trumpet". The English form clarinet is found as early as 1733, and the now-archaic clarionet appears from 1784 until the early years of the 20th century. <p><img src="/g-g-hotel-and-suite/clarinet1.jfif" alt="" height="auto"></p> <p><img src="/g-g-hotel-and-suite/clarinet2.jfif" alt="" height="auto"></p>
