      The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone (string
      instrument) in the violin family. Most violins have a hollow wooden body.
      It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in the
      family in regular use.[a] The violin typically has four strings, (some can
      have five), usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5, and
      is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings. It can also
      be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and, in
      specialized cases, by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow
      (col legno). Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of
      musical genres. They are most prominent in the Western classical
      tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as
      solo instruments. Violins are also important in many varieties of folk
      music, including country music, bluegrass music, and in jazz. Electric
      violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms
      of rock music and jazz fusion, with the pickups plugged into instrument
      amplifiers and speakers to produce sound. The violin has come to be
      incorporated in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music
      and Iranian music. The name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of
      music played on it. The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy, with
      some further modifications occurring in the 18th and 19th centuries to
      give the instrument a more powerful sound and projection. In Europe, it
      served as the basis for the development of other stringed instruments used
      in Western classical music, such as the viola.[1][2][3] Violinists and
      collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the
      Stradivari, Guarneri, Guadagnini and Amati families from the 16th to the
      18th century in Brescia and Cremona (Italy) and by Jacob Stainer in
      Austria. According to their reputation, the quality of their sound has
      defied attempts to explain or equal it, though this belief is
      disputed.[4][5] Great numbers of instruments have come from the hands of
      less famous makers, as well as still greater numbers of mass-produced
      commercial "trade violins" coming from cottage industries in places such
      as Saxony, Bohemia, and Mirecourt. Many of these trade instruments were
      formerly sold by Sears, Roebuck and Co. and other mass merchandisers. The
      components of a violin are usually made from different types of wood.
      Violins can be strung with gut, Perlon or other synthetic, or steel
      strings. A person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier or
      violinmaker. One who makes or repairs bows is called an archetier or
      bowmaker.

        The word "violin" was first used in English in the 1570s. The word "violin" comes from "Italian violino, [a] diminutive of viola. The term "viola" comes from the expression for "tenor violin" in 1797, from Italian and Old Provençal viola, [which came from] Medieval Latin vitula as a term which means "stringed instrument," perhaps [coming] from Vitula, Roman goddess of joy..., or from related Latin verb vitulari, "to cry out in joy or exaltation."[7] The related term "Viola da gamba" meaning "bass viol" (1724) is from Italian, literally "a viola for the leg" (i.e. to hold between the legs)."[7] A violin is the "modern form of the smaller, medieval viola da braccio." ("arm viola")
The violin is often called a fiddle, either when used in a folk music context, or even in Classical music scenes, as an informal nickname for the instrument. The word "fiddle" was first used in English in the late 14th century. The word "fiddle" comes from "fedele, fydyll, fidel, earlier fithele, from Old English fiðele "fiddle," which is related to Old Norse fiðla, Middle Dutch vedele, Dutch vedel, Old High German fidula, German Fiedel, "a fiddle;" all of uncertain origin." As to the origin of the word "fiddle", the "...usual suggestion, based on resemblance in sound and sense, is that it is from Medieval Latin vitula. <p><img src="/g-g-hotel-and-suite/violin.jfif" alt="image of violin" height="auto"> <img src="/g-g-hotel-and-suite/images.jfif" alt="" height="auto"></p>
