     <p>The trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group 
       ranges from the piccolo trumpet with the highest register in the brass family, to the bass trumpet, 
       which is pitched one octave below the standard B♭ or C Trumpet.</p>

     <p>Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with 
       examples dating back to at least 1500 BC. They began to be used as musical instruments only in the late 
       14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, 
       concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through 
       nearly-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a "buzzing" sound that starts a standing 
       wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century, trumpets have 
       primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape.</p>

     <p>There are many distinct types of trumpet, with the most common being pitched in B♭ (a transposing 
       instrument), having a tubing length of about 1.48 m (4 ft 10 in). Early trumpets did not provide means 
       to change the length of tubing, whereas modern instruments generally have three (or sometimes four) 
       valves in order to change their pitch. Most trumpets have valves of the piston type, while some have 
       the rotary type. The use of rotary-valved trumpets is more common in orchestral settings (especially in 
       German and German-style orchestras), although this practice varies by country. A musician who plays the 
       trumpet is called a trumpet player or trumpeter.</p>

      <b><ins>History</ins></b>
    </h2>
    The earliest trumpets date back to 1500 BC and earlier. The bronze and
    silver Tutankhamun's trumpets from his grave in Egypt, bronze lurs from
    Scandinavia, and metal trumpets from China date back to this period.
    Trumpets from the Oxus civilization (3rd millennium BC) of Central Asia have
    decorated swellings in the middle, yet are made out of one sheet of metal,
    which is considered a technical wonder for its time.
    <p>
      The Shofar, made from a ram horn and the Hatzotzeroth, made of metal, are
      both mentioned in the Bible. They were said to have been played in
      Solomon's Temple around 3,000 years ago. They were said to be used to blow
      down the walls of Jericho. They are still used on certain religious days.
      The Salpinx was a straight trumpet 62 inches (1,600 mm) long, made of bone
      or bronze. Salpinx contests were a part of the original Olympic Games.
    </p>
    The Moche people of ancient Peru depicted trumpets in their art going back
    to AD 300. The earliest trumpets were signaling instruments used for
    military or religious purposes, rather than music in the modern sense; and
    the modern bugle continues this signaling tradition.
    <p>
      Reproduction baroque trumpet by Michael Laird Improvements to instrument
      design and metal making in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance led to an
      increased usefulness of the trumpet as a musical instrument. The natural
      trumpets of this era consisted of a single coiled tube without valves and
      therefore could only produce the notes of a single overtone series.
    </p>
    <p>
      Changing keys required the player to change crooks of the instrument. The
      development of the upper, "clarino" register by specialist
      trumpeters—notably Cesare Bendinelli—would lend itself well to the Baroque
      era, also known as the "Golden Age of the natural trumpet." During this
      period, a vast body of music was written for virtuoso trumpeters. The art
      was revived in the mid-20th century and natural trumpet playing is again a
      thriving art around the world. Many modern players in Germany and the UK
      who perform Baroque music use a version of the natural trumpet fitted with
      three or four vent holes to aid in correcting out-of-tune notes in the
      harmonic series.
    </p>
    <p>
      The melody-dominated homophony of the classical and romantic periods
      relegated the trumpet to a secondary role by most major composers owing to
      the limitations of the natural trumpet. Berlioz wrote in
      1844:Notwithstanding the real loftiness and distinguished nature of its
      quality of tone, there are few instruments that have been more degraded
      (than the trumpet). Down to Beethoven and Weber, every composer- not
      excepting Mozart-persisted in confining it to the unworthy function of
      filling up, or in causing it to sound two or three commonplace rhythmical
      formulae.

      The trumpet is constructed of brass tubing bent twice into a rounded
      oblong shape. As with all brass instruments, sound is produced by blowing
      air through closed lips, producing a "buzzing" sound into the mouthpiece
      and starting a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the
      trumpet. The player can select the pitch from a range of overtones or
      harmonics by changing the lip aperture and tension (known as the
      embouchure).
    </p>

    <p>
      The mouthpiece has a circular rim, which provides a comfortable
      environment for the lips' vibration. Directly behind the rim is the cup,
      which channels the air into a much smaller opening (the back bore or
      shank) that tapers out slightly to match the diameter of the trumpet's
      lead pipe. The dimensions of these parts of the mouthpiece affect the
      timbre or quality of sound, the ease of playability, and player comfort.
      Generally, the wider and deeper the cup, the darker the sound and timbre.
    </p>
    Modern trumpets have three (or, infrequently, four) piston valves, each of
    which increases the length of tubing when engaged, thereby lowering the
    pitch. The first valve lowers the instrument's pitch by a whole step (two
    semitones), the second valve by a half step (one semitone), and the third
    valve by one and a half steps (three semitones). Having three valves
    provides eight possible valve combinations (including "none"), but only
    seven different tubing lengths, because the third valve alone gives
    essentially the same tubing length as the 1-2 combination. (In practice
    there is often a deliberately-designed slight difference between "1-2" and
    "3", and in that case trumpet players will select the alternative that gives
    the best tuning for the particular note being played.) When a fourth valve
    is present, as with some piccolo trumpets, it usually lowers the pitch a
    perfect fourth (five semitones). Used singly and in combination these valves
    make the instrument fully chromatic, i.e., able to play all twelve pitches
    of classical music. For more information about the different types of
    valves, see Brass instrument valves.

    <p>
      The pitch of the trumpet can be raised or lowered by the use of the tuning
      slide. Pulling the slide out lowers the pitch; pushing the slide in raises
      it. To overcome the problems of intonation and reduce the use of the
      slide, Renold Schilke designed the tuning-bell trumpet. Removing the usual
      brace between the bell and a valve body allows the use of a sliding bell;
      the player may then tune the horn with the bell while leaving the slide
      pushed in, or nearly so, thereby improving intonation and overall
      response.
    </p>

    <p>
      A trumpet becomes a closed tube when the player presses it to the lips;
      therefore, the instrument only naturally produces every other overtone of
      the harmonic series. The shape of the bell makes the missing overtones
      audible. Most notes in the series are slightly out of tune and modern
      trumpets have slide mechanisms for the first and third valves with which
      the player can compensate by throwing (extending) or retracting one or
      both slides, using the left thumb and ring finger for the first and third
      valve slides respectively.
    </p>

    Trumpets can be constructed from other materials, including plastic.
