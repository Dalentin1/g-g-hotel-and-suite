      The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone (string
      instrument) in the violin family. Most violins have a hollow wooden body.
      It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in the
      family in regular use. The violin typically has four strings, (some can
      have five), usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5, and
      is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings. It can also
      be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and, in
      specialized cases, by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow
      (col legno). Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of
      musical genres. They are most prominent in the Western classical
      tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as
      solo instruments. Violins are also important in many varieties of folk
      music, including country music, bluegrass music, and in jazz. Electric
      violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms
      of rock music and jazz fusion, with the pickups plugged into instrument
      amplifiers and speakers to produce sound. The violin has come to be
      incorporated in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music
      and Iranian music. The name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of
      music played on it. The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy, with
      some further modifications occurring in the 18th and 19th centuries to
      give the instrument a more powerful sound and projection. In Europe, it
      served as the basis for the development of other stringed instruments used
      in Western classical music, such as the viola. Violinists and
      collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the
      Stradivari, Guarneri, Guadagnini and Amati families from the 16th to the
      18th century in Brescia and Cremona (Italy) and by Jacob Stainer in
      Austria. According to their reputation, the quality of their sound has
      defied attempts to explain or equal it, though this belief is
      disputed. Great numbers of instruments have come from the hands of
      less famous makers, as well as still greater numbers of mass-produced
      commercial "trade violins" coming from cottage industries in places such
      as Saxony, Bohemia, and Mirecourt. Many of these trade instruments were
      formerly sold by Sears, Roebuck and Co. and other mass merchandisers. The
      components of a violin are usually made from different types of wood.
      Violins can be strung with gut, Perlon or other synthetic, or steel
      strings. A person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier or
      violinmaker. One who makes or repairs bows is called an archetier or
      bowmaker.

      The earliest stringed instruments were mostly plucked (for example, the Greek lyre). Two-stringed, 
      bowed instruments, played upright and strung and bowed with horsehair, may have originated in the 
      nomadic equestrian cultures of Central Asia, in forms closely resembling the modern-day Mongolian Morin 
      huur and the Kazakh Kobyz. Similar and variant types were probably disseminated along east-west trading 
      routes from Asia into the Middle East, and the Byzantine Empire. The direct ancestor of all European 
      bowed instruments is the Arabic rebab which developed into the Byzantine lyra by the 9th century and 
      later the European rebec. The first makers of violins probably borrowed from various 
      developments of the Byzantine lyra. These included the vielle (also known as the fidel or viuola) and 
      the <i>lira da braccio</i> . The violin in its present form emerged in early 16th-century northern Italy.
      <mark>The earliest pictures of violins, albeit with three strings, are seen in northern Italy around 1530, at 
      around the same time as the words "violino" and "vyollon" are seen in Italian and French documents. One 
      of the earliest explicit descriptions of the instrument, including its tuning, is from the Epitome 
      musical by Jambe de Fer, sub published in Lyon in 1556.</mark> By this time, the violin had already begun to spread 
      throughout Europe. The violin proved very popular, both among street musicians and the nobility; the 
      French king Charles IX ordered Andrea Amati to construct 24 violins for him in 1560. One of these "noble"
      instruments, the Charles IX, is the oldest surviving violin. The finest Renaissance carved and decorated 
      violin in the world is the Gasparo da Sal√≤ (c.1574) owned by Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria and later,
      from 1841, by the Norwegian virtuoso Ole Bull, who used it for forty years and thousands of concerts, for
       its very powerful and beautiful tone, similar to that of a Guarneri."The Messiah" or "Le Messie" 
       (also known as the "Salabue") made by Antonio Stradivari in 1716 remains pristine. It is now located in 
       the Ashmolean Museum of Oxford.
