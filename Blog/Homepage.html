      <h2><b><ins>Musical Instruments Classification</ins></b></h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the study of musical instruments, organology, 
      there are many different methods of classifying musical instruments. 
      Most methods are specific to a particular cultural group and were developed to serve the requirements 
      of that culture and its musical needs. Such classification schemes often break down when applied outside 
      of their original context. For example, a classification based on instrument use may fail when applied to
      culture which has a different use, or even multiple uses, for the same instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout history, various methods of musical instrument classification have been used by musicians & 
      scholars. The most commonly used system divides instruments into string instruments (often divided into 
      plucked and bowed), wind instruments (often divided into woodwind and brass), and percussion instruments 
      with modern classifications adding electronic instruments as a distinct class of instrument; however, 
      other schemes have also been devised.
    </p>
    <p><b>The original Sachs-Hornbostel system classified instruments into four main groups:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Idiophones:</b> such as the xylophone, which produce sound by vibrating themselves</li>
      <li><b>Membranophones:</b> such as drums or kazoos, which produce sound by a vibrating membrane</li>
      <li><b>Chordophones:</b> such as the piano or cello, which produce sound by vibrating strings</li>
      <li><b>Aerophones:</b> such as the pipe organ or oboe, which produce sound by vibrating columns of air.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Elementary organology categorizes musical instruments by their classical element:</p>

     <h3>Western Instruments</h3>
      <p>
        That was just a brief explanation of musical instruments and how they are categorized. But today we want
        to talk about Western instruments. But today we are going to be talking about the instruments used in playing
      classical music. There are main grouped into 4 parts.
      </p>
    <li>Strings</li>
    <li>Woodwind</li>
    <li>Brass</li>
    <li>Precussion</li>
    <p>
      We would be talinkg about 2 instruments from the Strings family, the Brass
      family then one from the woodwind family.
