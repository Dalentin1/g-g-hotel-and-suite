      The clarinet is a type of single-reed woodwind instrument. Like many wind
      instruments, clarinets are made in several different sizes, each having
      its own range of pitches. All have a nearly-cylindrical bore and a flared
      bell, and utilize a mouthpiece with a single reed. A person who plays a
      clarinet is called a clarinetist (sometimes spelled clarinettist). While
      the similarity in sound between the earliest clarinets and the trumpet may
      hold a clue to its name, other factors may have been involved. During the
      Late Baroque era, composers such as Bach and Handel were making new
      demands on the skills of their trumpeters, who were often required to play
      difficult melodic passages in the high, or as it came to be called,
      "clarion" register. Since the trumpets of this time had no valves or
      pistons, melodic passages would often require the use of the highest part
      of the trumpet's range, where the harmonics were close enough together to
      produce scales of adjacent notes. The trumpet parts that required this
      specialty were known by the term clarino and this in turn came to apply to
      the musicians themselves. The word clarinet may have come from the
      diminutive version of the clarion or clarino and it has been suggested
      that clarino players may have helped themselves out by playing
      particularly difficult passages on these newly developed "mock
      trumpets".[1] Johann Christoph Denner is generally believed to have
      invented the clarinet in Germany around the year 1700 by adding a register
      key to the earlier chalumeau, usually in the key of C. Over time,
      additional keywork and airtight pads were added to improve the tone and
      playability.[2] The most common clarinet is the B♭ clarinet. The clarinet
      in A, pitched a semitone lower, is also regularly used in orchestral,
      chamber, and solo music. The bass clarinet has been common in orchestras
      since the middle of the 19th century. The modern bass clarinet is in B♭
      but has extra keys to extend the register down to low written C3. The
      clarinet family ranges from the (extremely rare) BBB♭ octo-contrabass to
      the A♭ piccolo clarinet. The clarinet is used in classical music, concert
      bands, military bands, marching bands, klezmer, jazz, and other styles.

        <h3><b>Lineage</b></h3>
        The clarinet has its roots in the early single-reed instruments or hornpipes used in Ancient Greece, 
        Ancient Egypt, Middle East, and Europe since the Middle Ages, such as the albogue, alboka, and 
        double clarinet. The modern clarinet developed from a Baroque instrument called the chalumeau. This 
        instrument was similar to a recorder, but with a single-reed mouthpiece and a cylindrical bore. Lacking
        a register key, it was played mainly in its fundamental register, with a limited range of about one 
        and a half octaves. It had eight finger holes, like a recorder, and two keys for its two highest 
        notes. At this time, contrary to modern practice, the reed was placed in contact with the upper lip.
        Around the turn of the 18th century, the chalumeau was modified by converting one of its keys into a 
        register key to produce the first clarinet. This development is usually attributed to German instrument
        maker Johann Christoph Denner, though some have suggested his son Jacob Denner was the inventor. This 
        instrument played well in the middle register with a loud, shrill sound, so it was given the name 
        clarinetto meaning "little trumpet" (from clarino + -etto). Early clarinets did not play well in the 
        lower register, so players continued to play the chalumeaux for low notes.[64] As clarinets improved, 
        the chalumeau fell into disuse, and these notes became known as the chalumeau register. Original Denner
        clarinets had two keys, and could play a chromatic scale, but various makers added more keys to get 
        improved tuning, easier fingerings, and a slightly larger range.[64] The classical clarinet of Mozart's
        day typically had five keys. Clarinets were soon accepted into orchestras. Later models had a mellower 
        tone than the originals. Mozart (d. 1791) liked the sound of the clarinet (he considered its tone the 
        closest in quality to the human voice) and wrote numerous pieces for the instrument, and by the time of
        Beethoven (c. 1800-1820), the clarinet was a standard fixture in the orchestra.
        <h3><b>Pads</b></h3>
        The next major development in the history of clarinet was the invention of the modern pad. Because 
        early clarinets used felt pads to cover the tone holes, they leaked air. This required pad-covered holes
        to be kept to a minimum, restricting the number of notes the clarinet could play with good tone. In 
        1812, Iwan Müller, a Baltic German community-born clarinetist and inventor, developed a new type of pad
        that was covered in leather or fish bladder. It was airtight and let makers increase the number of 
        pad-covered holes. Müller designed a new type of clarinet with seven finger holes and thirteen keys.
        This allowed the instrument to play in any key with near-equal ease. Over the course of the 
        19th-century, makers made many enhancements to Müller's clarinet, such as the Albert system and the 
        Baermann system, all keeping the same basic design. Modern instruments may also have cork or synthetic 
        pads.
        <h3><b>Keywork and toneholes</b></h3>
        The final development in the modern design of the clarinet used in most of the world today was 
        introduced by Hyacinthe Klosé in 1839. He devised an arrangement of keys and toneholes that 
        simplified fingering. It was inspired by the Boehm system developed for flutes by Theobald Böhm. 
        Klose was so impressed by Bohm's invention that he named his own system for clarinets the Boehm system,
        although it is different from the one used on flutes. This new system was slow to gain popularity 
        but gradually became the standard, and today the Boehm system is used everywhere in the world except 
        Germany and Austria. These countries still use a direct descendant of the Mueller clarinet known as 
        the Oehler system clarinet. Also, some contemporary Dixieland players continue to use Albert 
        system clarinets. Other key systems have been developed, many built around modifications to the basic 
        Bohm system: Full Bohm, Mazzeo, McIntyre, Benade NX, and the Reform Boehm system.

            <h3><b>Materials</b></h3>
            Clarinet bodies have been made from a variety of materials including wood, plastic, hard rubber, 
            metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of clarinets used by professionals are made from 
            African hardwood, mpingo (African Blackwood) or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) 
            Honduran rosewood, and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were 
            used. Most inexpensive clarinets are made of plastic resin, such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's 
            trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early 20th 
            century until plastic instruments supplanted them;[39] metal construction is still used for the 
            bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass clarinets and the necks and bells of nearly all alto and 
            larger clarinets.[40] Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends to crack and 
            does not keep its shape well.[41] Buffet Crampon's Greenline clarinets are made from a composite 
            of grenadilla wood powder and carbon fiber.[42] Such clarinets are less affected by humidity and 
            temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. Hard rubber, such as ebonite, has 
            been used for clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it. Clarinet 
            designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber. Mouthpieces are 
            generally made of hard rubber, although some inexpensive mouthpieces may be made of plastic. Other
            materials such as crystal/glass, wood, ivory, and metal have also been used. Ligatures are often 
            made of metal and plated in nickel, silver, or gold. Other materials include wire, wire mesh, 
            plastic, naugahyde, string, or leather.
            <h3><b>Reed</b></h3>

            The clarinet uses a single reed made from the cane of Arundo donax, a type of grass. Reeds may also
            be manufactured from synthetic materials. The ligature fastens the reed to the mouthpiece. When 
            air is blown through the opening between the reed and the mouthpiece facing, the reed vibrates and
            produces the clarinet's sound. Basic reed measurements are as follows: tip, 12 millimetres 
            (0.47 in) wide; lay, 15 millimetres (0.59 in) long (distance from the place where the reed touches 
            the mouthpiece to the tip); gap, 1 millimetre (0.039 in) (distance between the underside of the 
            reed tip and the mouthpiece). Adjustment to these measurements is one method of affecting tone 
            color. Most clarinetists buy manufactured reeds, although many make adjustments to these reeds, and
            some make their own reeds from cane "blanks".[48] Reeds come in varying degrees of hardness, 
            generally indicated on a scale from one (soft) through five (hard). This numbering system is not 
            standardized—reeds with the same number often vary in hardness across manufacturers and models.
            Reed and mouthpiece characteristics work together to determine ease of playability, pitch 
            stability, and tonal characteristics.
            <h3><b>Components</b></h3>

            The reed is attached to the mouthpiece by the ligature, and the top half-inch or so of this 
            assembly is held in the player's mouth. In the past, string was used to bind the reed to the 
            mouthpiece. The formation of the mouth around the mouthpiece and reed is called the embouchure. 
            The reed is on the underside of the mouthpiece, pressing against the player's lower lip, while the 
            top teeth normally contact the top of the mouthpiece (some players roll the upper lip under the top
            teeth to form what is called a 'double-lip' embouchure). Adjustments in the strength and shape 
            of the embouchure change the tone and intonation (tuning). It is not uncommon for clarinetists to 
            employ methods to relieve the pressure on the upper teeth and inner lower lip by attaching pads to 
            the top of the mouthpiece or putting (temporary) padding on the front lower teeth, commonly from 
            folded paper. Next is the short barrel; this part of the instrument may be extended to fine-tune 
            the clarinet. As the pitch of the clarinet is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have 
            interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly. Additional compensation for pitch variation 
            and tuning can be made by pulling out the barrel and thus increasing the instrument's length, 
            particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments (such as in 
            an orchestra or concert band). On basset horns and lower clarinets, the barrel is normally replaced
            by a curved metal neck. The main body of most clarinets is divided into the upper joint, the holes
            and most keys of which are operated by the left hand, and the lower joint with holes and most keys 
            operated by the right hand. Some clarinets have a single joint: on some basset horns and larger 
            clarinets the two joints are held together with a screw clamp and are usually not disassembled for 
            storage. The left thumb operates both a tone hole and the register key. On some models of clarinet,
            such as many Albert system clarinets and increasingly some higher-end Böhm system clarinets, the 
            register key is a 'wraparound' key, with the key on the back of the clarinet and the pad on the 
            front. Advocates claim that this key configuration improves sound and makes moisture less likely 
            to accumulate in the tube beneath the pad,but these keys can be harder to keep in adjustment.
